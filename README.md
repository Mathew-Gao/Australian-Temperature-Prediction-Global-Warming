# Australian Temperature Modelling & Prediction 

This project explores the MonthlyTemp.csv data set containing monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as highest and lowest temperatures observed at Laverton RAAF weather station in Melbourne. The aim is to provide a data-driven analysis of climate change in Melbourne and determine if there is evidence of global warming based on the data.

# Files:

**⋅1 Australian Temperature Modelling & Prediction.rmd**: R Markdown file containing the code and analysis for the project.

**⋅2 MonthlyTemp.csv**: Data file containing the monthly temperature data for Laverton RAAF from January 1950 to December 2021.

**⋅3 Evidence of Global Warming.pdf**: Report summarizing the analysis and results of the project.

# Analysis:

The analysis in this project includes graphical exploration of the data, time series decomposition, regression analysis, forecast evaluation, and prediction of quantities of interest outside the data sample. The analysis is aimed at readers who are literate, but not necessarily experts in statistical analysis.

# Structure & usage:
The report includes an executive summary, discussions of the issues at hand and any exploratory data features, a succinct description of the technical analysis process, discussions of key results with relevant statistics appropriately summarized in table formats, and a conclusion and limitations section.

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, download the MonthlyTemp.csv data file and the Australian Temperature Modelling & Prediction.rmd R Markdown file. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio and run the code chunks to execute the analysis.

# Note: 

The data used in this project is publicly available and can be used for research and educational purposes. However, the analysis and results presented in the report are based on the data and assumptions made by the author and should not be taken as definitive evidence of global warming in Melbourne.
